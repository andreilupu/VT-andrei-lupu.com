# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how

# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'

# (required) The domains to take screenshots of.
domains:
  current:  "https://andrei-lupu.com"
  new:      "https://aldev.ro/al_test"

# (required) The paths to capture. All paths should exist for both of the domains specified above.
# (required) The paths to capture. This particular config is using casperjs, so we can take screenshots of selectors rather than the entire page.
paths:
  home:
    path: '/'
    selector: 'body'
  about:
    path: '/about-me'
    selector: 'body'
  gridable_article:
    path: '/wordpress/introducing-gridable-the-missing-grid-content-editor'
    selector: 'body'
  second_article:
    path: '/programming/automated-testing-what-can-they-bring/'
    selector: 'body'
  wordpress_category:
    path: '/category/wordpress/'

  open_menu:
    path: '/'
    selector: "body"
    before_capture: 'javascript/interactions/open--menu.js'

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
screen_widths:
  - 400

  - 1440
# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
before_capture: 'javascript/interactions/select--body.js'

# (required) The directory that your screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'vs_al_test'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.

  thumb_height: 400

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_first

# (optional) Choose to run Wraith in verbose mode, for easier debugging. Default: false
